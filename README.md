# Instant-Police-Collaborator using AWS Rekognition

This is a software that would be dedicated to Police Department. This software can bring automation in the place of control rooms at several local places. The aim is to provide a software solution using AI, so that any kind of Physical violence or MOLESTATION get detected and real time alert is sent directly to the police HQ with location of crime scene, so that they can dispatch any nearby unit as soon as possible to the crime scene.
By using this, instant help can be provided to the victim and a terrible crime can be prevented from happening.
We created a web portal for the HQ to manage all this.
On the portal, their is a separate column for warnings, whichever thing or activity is detected is shown their.

# All feature of the software:-
- Violence Detection
- Car License Plate Detection
- Suspect Tracking
- A website to manage and show the activities in real time.

Let's say someone stole your car, then policeman will just enter the Car License Number in the web Portal then each and every camera will find that particular license plate. If it is found then the notification will appear on the web portal with location of the car.

Suppose police has to find a suspect, then they just need to upload an image of the suspect's face to the web portal and each and every camera will find that particular person. If it is found then the notification will appear on the web portal with location of the suspect.

The website has a very clean, attractive and easy to use interface.
